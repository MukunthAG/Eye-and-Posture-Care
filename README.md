# Eye & Posture Care
A simple chrome extension which periodically reminds you to relax your Eyes and adjust your Posture. 

To enable the extension, clone this repo or download and extract the zip file. This main folder contains all the files required for our extension. After that follow the instructions given below,
*  Open chrome, go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
*  Turn on developer mode
*  Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder you just downloaded!

Features which would improve the current build -
*  Strict Mode (Closing the window before 20 seconds results in closing of all the tabs!)
*  Improved Design
*  Sound 
*  Desktop Notifications when chrome is inactive as it would be annoying if suddenly a new window opening from the background(when strict mode off)
